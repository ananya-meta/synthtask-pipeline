LLM-as-a-Judge has become the dominant evaluation paradigm for language models, but judge validation in practice relies on exact-match agreement, a metric that does not correct for chance and systematically overstates discriminative ability. We present the largest systematic evaluation of LLM-as-a-Judge to date: 21 judges from nine providers across MT-Bench, JudgeBench, and RewardBench, evaluated under three protocols (agreement, consistency, bias audit) over 118 runs and approximately $541,000$ individual judgments. Four findings emerge, consistent across the full cohort, including the April 2026 frontier: kappa deflation between exact match and Cohen's $$ is universal ($33$--$41$ pp on MT-Bench), judge rankings shift by up to 14 positions across benchmarks, high test--retest reliability ($>0.95$) coexists with severe position bias ($>0.10$) in two production-deployed judges (instantiating a consistency--bias paradox), and verbosity bias is small ($<0.011$) across our cohort under a single pairwise rubric. We distill these into a Minimum Viable Validation Protocol.

[Section: Introduction]
Large language models (LLMs) increasingly evaluate large-scale content~. These ``judgments'' rely on the model's ability to mimic a human evaluator on tasks requiring analytical acuity. Such judges are widely deployed in production evaluation pipelines across hundreds of documented LLMOps deployments . This proliferation has accelerated despite well-documented reliability issues with LLM use for reasoning tasks . 

Surveys of LLM-as-Judge (LLMaJ) reliability identify a recurring set of failure modes: inconsistency across prompts and runs, systematic scoring biases, weak domain-specific calibration, and the absence of meta-evaluation standards for comparing judges on equal footing.

Despite these challenges, judge validation continues to rely heavily on exact match. Established judge benchmarks---MT-Bench , RewardBench , JudgeBench ---and recent successors privilege raw agreement as the headline validation metric. This family of metrics does not correct for chance and overstates discriminative ability .

No prior work has conducted a large-scale, cross-benchmark, multi-protocol evaluation of judge reliability across model families and generations. We present the largest such evaluation: 21 models from nine providers across three benchmarks and three evaluation protocols, producing 541,000 judgments over 118 runs.

We report five principal findings, including two diagnostic concepts. First, kappa deflation: raw agreement overstates chance-corrected discrimination by 33--41pp in all 21 evaluated models. Second, judge rankings are non-transferable: models shift by as many as 14 positions across benchmarks. Third, the consistency--bias paradox: high test--retest reliability often masks severe position bias. Fourth, verbosity bias is much reduced: all 21 models register $<$0.011, in sharp contrast to the 20--40\

[Section: Related Work]
The LLMaJ paradigm originated with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena . Rapid adoption followed across diverse evaluation settings, including G-Eval for natural-language-generation tasks , AlpacaEval for instruction-following , Arena-Hard for separating model performance from crowdsourced preference data , and WildBench for real-user prompts . LLMaJ is now widely deployed in industrial evaluation pipelines, and has emerged as the dominant pattern for reference-free scoring across hundreds of production LLM deployments .

Evaluation of LLMaJ has expanded rapidly in response to the widespread adoption of the approach. The field faces distinct challenges surrounding reliability, consistency, and bias mitigation, which have prompted some emergent remedies . For example, prior work has documented biases inherited from pretraining corpora, difficulty adapting evaluation criteria across domains, and unresolved questions about consensus among cooperating judge models . Other work identifies inconsistency under temperature and prompt variation , introduces reliability coefficients , evaluates rating-indeterminacy , and examines latent dimensions of reliability . 
Closest in scale to our work, surveys 11 LLM judges across 20 NLP evaluation tasks and recommends careful validation against task-specific annotation before deployment.

[Section: LLM Judge Metrics and Definitions]
Exact match is the proportion of items on which the judge's verdict matches the human label. We follow in reporting the tie-excluded variant for pairwise comparisons, restricting the denominator to items on which the human label is non-tie~. Despite being widely used, exact match does not correct for agreement expected by chance, and as a result exact match is sensitive to the label distribution of the underlying benchmark.

Cohen's $$ is a chance-corrected measure of agreement between two raters on categorical labels:

= 1 - p_e,

where $p_o$ is the observed agreement and $p_e$ is the agreement expected by chance under the marginal label distributions of the two raters . We use $$ as our primary agreement metric and compare each judge against the human label set on all benchmarks. Krippendorff's $$ is a reliability coefficient that accommodates more than two raters as well as ordinal and interval scales. The two measures coincide for the two-rater nominal case, but $$ extends naturally to the multi-run consistency setting introduced below.

Test-retest reliability is the agreement of a judge with itself across independent re-evaluations of the same items. The concept captures the stability of verdicts under identical conditions, and is a necessary but insufficient characteristic of a quality judge.

Self-consistency is the proportion of items on which the majority verdict across $N$ runs agrees with each individual run, capturing within-judge agreement at the item level and complementing the corpus-level test--retest coefficient.

Position flip rate is the fraction of items for which the judge's verdict changes when the response order is swapped , providing an item-level measure of position sensitivity that complements the aggregate position-bias statistic defined next.

Position bias is the tendency of a judge to favor response in a particular position .

Across a range of judge models, flip rates range from $25\

Verbosity bias is the tendency of a judge to prefer longer responses regardless of content quality . Following , we operationalize verbosity bias as the Pearson correlation between the response-length differential $|(A)| - |(B)|$ and the judge's verdict.

Kappa deflation is the difference between exact match and Cohen's $$ for a given judge--benchmark pair:

_(j, b) = (j, b) - (j, b).

$_$ quantifies how much raw agreement overstates chance-corrected discriminative ability. We introduce this term to name a phenomenon that, while mathematically a direct consequence of Cohen's correction , has not been systematically measured or reported at scale across modern LLM judges. On MT-Bench we observe $_ [33.8, 41.2]$ percentage points across all 21 models tested.

Consistency-bias paradox is the empirical observation that high test-retest reliability ($ > 0.95$) can coexist with severe position bias in the same judge model, such that the judge is highly reproducible but not valid. We introduce this term to formalize a failure mode reachable by reporting test-retest alone . The paradox arises because test-retest measures the stability of outputs and not the correctness of the underlying decision process: a judge that deterministically favors position $A$ across runs would achieve a perfect test-retest score, but would also exhibit maximum-possible position bias.

[Section: Benchmarks]
We evaluate every judge on three benchmarks of increasing difficulty. MT-Bench contributes 2,391 pairwise comparisons with expert human judgments and is the most widely-used judge-evaluation benchmark . JudgeBench contributes 350 items spanning mathematics, coding, creative writing, and analysis labeled for objective correctness rather than aesthetic preference . RewardBench contributes 2,981 chosen-versus-rejected pairs, presented to each judge under per-item position randomization so that the chosen response is equally likely to occupy either position .

[Section: Evaluation Protocols]
We measure judge behavior under three protocols. First, the agreement protocol produces a single judgment per item and compares it to the human label, reporting Cohen's $$, Krippendorff's $$, and tie-excluded exact match. Second, the consistency protocol runs $N [3, 5]$ independent evaluations per item with response caching disabled, presenting each pair in both AB and BA orderings, and reports test--retest reliability, self-consistency, and position flip rate. Third, the bias-audit protocol presents AB+BA orderings together with response-length analysis, and reports position bias and verbosity bias.

[Section: Hypotheses]
We formulate seven hypotheses before running frontier-model evaluation and list them here so that readers can assess our findings against a priori predictions. H1: Kappa deflation will persist within frontier models. H2: Thinking-architecture models (GPT-5.4, Gemini 3.1 Pro, DeepSeek V3.2) will exhibit position bias below $0.05$. H3: Cross-benchmark rank divergence will be at least three positions for some model. H4: MT-Bench will show a limited $$ spread, defined as the distance between the largest and smallest Cohen's $$. H5: Issues with RewardBench, (human labels are all in the A position), will persist under generative evaluation. As a result, $$ values will be very small, no larger than $0.05$. H6: Position flip rate will degrade by at least a factor of $1.5$ from MT-Bench to JudgeBench. H7: At least one model will exhibit test-retest reliability greater than $0.95$ and with position bias greater than $0.10$.

[Section: Experimental Procedure]
We conducted model evaluation in seven phases over a five-week window during March and April 2026. A detailed summary is in Appendix~. The full procedure produced 118 evaluation runs, and approximately $541,000$ judgments. All evaluations used temperature $0$. In order to ensure that replicate runs sample independent generations rather than memorized responses, we execute the consistency protocol with response caching disabled. Position-swap debiasing (AB+BA paired evaluations) was applied in both the consistency and bias-audit protocols. Every run was executed with a bespoke research evaluation library (that will be released open source upon publication) which implements the 14 metrics for each model.

[Section: Kappa Deflation Is Universal]
~(a) plots the dumbbell of exact match and $$ values for each judge on MT-Bench and reports $$, exact match, and $_$ for all three benchmarks. Every judge in our study exhibits substantial kappa deflation on MT-Bench: exact match overstates chance-corrected agreement by between $33.8$ and $41.3$ percentage points across the 21 models, with a cohort mean of $38.6$ pp. The deflation is universal across capability tiers: all ten frontier-generation (Tier 3) judges exhibit $_ 30$ pp, supporting H1. Even the judge that performed best on chance-corrected agreement, Gemini 3.1 Pro, shows a $33.8$ pp gap between exact match () and chance-corrected ($ = 0.511$) performance.

The magnitude of deflation varies systematically with the benchmark's label distribution. MT-Bench, with a balanced A/B/Tie distribution, produces the largest mean deflation ($38.6$ pp); JudgeBench's pairwise correctness-labeled items produce a mean of $23.7$ pp (range $8.1$ to $38.5$); RewardBench's binary chosen-versus-rejected pairs produce $10.4$ pp (range $5.9$ to $21.3$). Balanced label distributions raise expected-by-chance agreement, which inflates the gap between raw and chance-corrected metrics. The practical consequence is that a judge reporting ``$85\

[Section: Position Bias Heterogeneity]
, column 2, reports position biases for each model. The least position biased model, Gemini 2.5 Pro ($pb = 0.002$) and most position biased model Qwen 3 8B ($pb = 0.192$) span nearly two orders of magnitude difference in position bias. In this evaluation, reasoning and frontier models have systematically lower rates of position bias; small, and cost-optimized models have the highest rates of position bias. Within-family heterogeneity is large: Gemini 2.5 Pro ($0.002$) and Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.125$) differ by a factor of $70$. H2 predicted that the three thinking-architecture judges (GPT-5.4, Gemini 3.1 Pro, DeepSeek V3.2) would all fall below $0.05$; only Gemini 3.1 Pro ($0.038$) does so. And so, while they reduce position bias relative to cost-efficient models, they do not eliminate it.

[Section: Cross-Benchmark Rank Instability]
Consistent with Hypothesis 3, benchmark choice has an appreciable effect on relative rankings of performance. More than half ($11$ of the $21$) shift by four or more positions, and only Gemini 3.1 Pro and Claude Opus 4.6 hold a top-three position across all three benchmarks. The largest single shift is Llama 3.3 70B which shifts $15$ positions, from 5 on MT-Bench to 20 on JudgeBench. Other notable cases include 
Minimax M2.7 (MT:17, JB:5), 
DeepSeek V3.2 (MT:3, JB:13), 
GPT-4o (MT:8, JB:18), 
GPT-oss 120B (MT:12, RB:3), and 
Claude Haiku 4.5 (MT:15, RB:6). 
(Supplementary figure visualizes highlighting position changes.) 

The instability is amplified by sharp differences in benchmark discriminability: MT-Bench compresses all $21$ judges into a $13.5$ pp $$ band ($0.376$ to $0.511$) with an average gap of $0.6$ pp between adjacent ranks; JudgeBench spreads the same models over $60.4$ pp ($0.271$ to $0.875$) with $3$--$9$ pp tiers; RewardBench falls between at $28.1$ pp ($0.616$ to $0.898$), with the top seven judges within a tight $2.7$ pp band followed by gradual separation. Where the underlying distribution is compressed, small $$ differences produce large rank changes, and a model's apparent ranking on a single benchmark is a poor estimator of its ranking on others.

[Section: MT-Bench Ceiling Effect]
Hypothesis 4 predicted an MT-Bench $$ spread of at most $5$ pp. As we report in Table , we observe $13.5$ pp ($0.376$ to $0.511$) across all 21 judges, narrowing to $6.5$ pp within the top ten and approaching the H4 ceiling. The wider full-cohort spread is driven by a distinct lower tier (GPT-5.4-mini, Mixtral 8x22B, GPT-4o-mini). JudgeBench's $$ spread on the same population is $60.4$ pp, a factor of $4.5$ wider, confirming that MT-Bench's preference-style label set compresses meaningful quality differences among strong judges.

[Section: Position-Randomized Evaluation of RewardBench]
Hypothesis 5 predicted that RewardBench would generate $$ values no larger than $0.05$ because it placed all correct human labels in the A position. As we report in the benchmark data is not consistent with this hypothesis. Under per-item position-randomized evaluation (loader configuration in Appendix~), all 20 evaluated judges produce $$ values in the range $[0.616, 0.898]$. The top five judges produce highly reasonable $$ values: Gemini 3.1 Pro $(0.898)$, GPT-oss 120B $(0.880)$, Claude Opus 4.6 $(0.879)$, GPT-5.4 $(0.879)$, and Claude Haiku 4.5 $(0.873)$. The full $$ spread on RewardBench is $28.1$ pp, between MT-Bench's $13.5$ pp and JudgeBench's $60.4$ pp, and the top tier is tightly clustered (the top seven judges fall within a $2.7$ pp band). (In the Appendix, summarises , making it easier to read ranks and $$ jointly across the three benchmarks.)

[Section: Consistency Falls on Hard Benchmarks]
Consistent with Hypothesis 6, seven of the sixteen judges evaluated under the consistency protocol show a position flip-rate increase of at least $1.5$ from MT-Bench to JudgeBench. The three most acute degradations are Llama 3.3 70B ($3.3$, $0.077$ to $0.253$), GPT-4o-mini ($3.0$, $0.127$ to $0.380$), and GLM-5 ($2.4$, $0.096$ to $0.227$). Two frontier judges go in the opposite direction: Claude Opus 4.6 and Gemini 3.1 Pro both improve by a factor of $0.58$ when moving from MT-Bench to JudgeBench, suggesting that some current-generation systems handle harder items with greater positional stability than they show on easier items. (In the appendix, plots all 16 trajectories together with the cohort medians ($0.09$ on MT-Bench, $0.17$ on JudgeBench)).

Test-retest reliability follows a similar pattern at the cohort level: the mean test--retest across the 16 judges drops from $0.943$ on MT-Bench to $0.911$ on JudgeBench. Per-judge values vary widely; for example, Gemini 2.5 Flash drops by $7.3$ pp ($0.988$ to $0.915$), while Gemini 3.1 Pro is essentially unchanged ($0.977$ to $0.978$). (In the appendix, we report per-judge MT and JB test--retest values in .)

[Section: The Consistency--Bias Paradox]
Hypothesis 7 predicted that at least one judge would exhibit test-retest reliability above $0.95$ together with position bias above $0.10$, evidence of the tradeoffs between consistency-bias. Two judges, Qwen 3 8B (test-retest $0.992$, position bias $0.192$) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (test-retest $0.988$, position bias $0.125$) generate such paradoxical results. ~(b) plots all 16 jointly evaluated judges in the test-retest by position-bias plane. Judges that occupy the upper-right region are those that demonstrate high test-retest reproducibility, but with high systematic bias.

Qwen 3 8B has the highest test-retest of judges evaluated in this study, but it simultaneously is among the most position biased judge in the cohort $(pb=0.192)$ and its JudgeBench $$ ($0.289$) is the third lowest. Model determinism produces the same response position across replicate runs, which yields near-perfect within-judge agreement, but it violates the requirement that verdicts be position-invariant. This result has methodological implications for future teams: test--retest measures the stability of a judge's outputs, not the correctness of the underlying decision process. Reporting test-retest alone stands to present a misleading picture of judge reliability.

[Section: Pairwise Verbosity Bias]
All 21 judges evaluated under the bias-audit protocol register a verbosity bias below $0.011$ on MT-Bench, with the largest value being GPT-4o-mini at $0.010$; 17 of the 21 judges fall below $0.005$, with the smallest values clustered around $0.001$. Per-judge values appear in . The magnitudes are an order of magnitude smaller than the variance contributions reported in $2023$-era studies of style and length effects , suggesting that verbosity sensitivity has fallen substantially as a practical concern over the past two model generations. We caution against generalizing this finding beyond our setting: the measurement uses a single pairwise rubric and a fixed length-differential operationalization , and we do not claim that verbosity bias has been eliminated under arbitrary rubric or task variation.

[Section: Model Family Analysis]
Several provider-family patterns are visible in the per-judge $$ values reported in . The three Anthropic judges average $ = 0.770$ on JudgeBench (Opus 4.6 $0.875$, Sonnet 4.6 $0.782$, Haiku 4.5 $0.653$) with an average position bias of $0.020$, the strongest joint performance on hard items and the lowest cohort-level bias of any provider. The three OpenAI flagships (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5.4) average $ = 0.467$ on JudgeBench, well below the Anthropic and Google frontier-tier figures. Within-OpenAI developed models, generational progression is visible: $$ rises from $0.309$ for GPT-4o to $0.487$ for GPT-4.1, and rises to $0.606$ for GPT-5.4. MT-Bench's compressed scale makes the same generational progression nearly invisible: the corresponding MT-Bench values are $0.451$, $0.451$, and $0.457$. 

Similarly, within-family scaling is more legible on JudgeBench than on MT-Bench. Claude Opus 4.6 ($ = 0.875$) is $9.3$ pp above Claude Sonnet 4.6 ($ = 0.782$) on JudgeBench; the corresponding MT-Bench values differ by $0.6$ pp (Opus $0.489$, Sonnet 4.6 $0.484$). Mid-tier judges can outperform frontier judges on specific dimensions: Kimi K2.5 records the lowest position bias of any non-Gemini judge ($0.004$), competitive with Claude Opus 4.6, while achieving JudgeBench $ = 0.720$ at a fraction of the frontier-tier cost. We return to cost-quality trade-offs in .

[Section: Why Exact Match Misleads]
Exact match rewards chance agreement as if it were genuine discrimination. On a balanced ternary label set such as MT-Bench, with the chance baseline $p_e 1/3$, exact-match values in $[0.80, 0.85]$ correspond to a Cohen's $$ near $0.48$. This is a moderate value, not the near-perfect band the percentage suggests. The $33.8$--$41.3$ pp gap we observe on MT-Bench is therefore not a model-quality artifact: it is how an uncorrected metric interacts with the label marginals of the benchmark . The cohort-mean $_$ contracts from $38.6$ pp on MT-Bench to $23.7$ pp on JudgeBench and $10.2$ pp on RewardBench, tracking the shift from balanced ternary to imbalanced binary labels exactly as Cohen's correction predicts.

Exact-match figures used to justify deploying LLM judges therefore may significantly overstate their chance-corrected discriminative ability by an amount that depends on the benchmark, not the judge . We recommend reporting Cohen's $$ or Krippendorff's $$ alongside any exact-match figure, with the chance-corrected metric (not the raw rate), treated as the headline reliability number. Figure~~(a) and Table~ illustrate the gap for every judge in our cohort.

[Section: Limits of Single-Benchmark Validation]
Cross-benchmark rank instability has two coupled drivers. First, benchmarks differ in discriminative power: MT-Bench compresses the $21$-judge cohort into a $13.5$ pp $$ band while JudgeBench spreads the same judges across $60.4$ pp, a $4.5$ wider range. Small absolute differences yield large rank changes. Second, the three benchmarks measure subtly different latent constructs (preference alignment, objective correctness, and chosen-vs-rejected discrimination, respectively), and a judge that looks strong under one construct can collapse under another. Llama 3.3 70B (MT$\#$5 $$ JB$\#$19) and Minimax M2.7 (MT$\#$16 $$ JB$\#$5) illustrate the two directions.

Only two judges (Claude Opus 4.6 and Gemini 3.1 Pro) hold a top-three position across all three benchmarks; ten of twenty-one exhibit a maximum pairwise rank shift of at least four positions. Practically, judge validation should report results from at least two benchmarks chosen to span the preference-versus-correctness axis rather than relying on the discriminability of any single dataset. Appendix Figure~ and Appendix Table~ report the full set of rank trajectories.

[Section: The Consistency--Bias Paradox and a Minimum Viable Validation Protocol]
Test--retest reliability measures output stability, not decision-process correctness. Position bias and within-judge agreement are mathematically orthogonal, so a judge that deterministically prefers position A across runs achieves near-perfect test--retest while exhibiting maximal position bias. Qwen 3 8B (test--retest $0.992$, position bias $0.192$, JudgeBench $ = 0.289$) is the empirical extreme. Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.988$, $0.125$) instantiates the same pattern more mildly. Because reporting test--retest alone remains common in LLMaJ validation , current reporting practice misleads precisely in the cases that matter most for deployment: highly reproducible judges. Figure~~(b) shows the dissociation across the $16$ jointly evaluated judges. This paradox motivates our recommended Minimum Viable Validation Protocol (MVVP) below.

Every run includes the per-item judge verdict, the model's free-form reasoning, the raw response, per-call latency, and the metric values computed for the run, so that downstream users can recompute any of our reported numbers from raw data or substitute their own metric and aggregation choices. The release supports three use cases we cannot pursue here: large-scale meta-analysis across judges and benchmarks (including variance-component decompositions across runs, items, and position orderings); development and validation of new calibration techniques on a fixed model$$benchmark population ; and a frozen baseline against which future judges can be evaluated under an identical protocol.

[Section: Conclusion]
We present the largest systematic evaluation of LLMaJ to date: $21$ judges from nine providers across three benchmarks and three measurement protocols, producing approximately $541,000$ individual judgments. Four findings are present across the full cohort, including the frontier models released through April 2026: kappa deflation between exact match and Cohen's $$ is universal ($33.8$--$41.3$ pp on MT-Bench); judge rankings shift by up to $14$ positions across benchmarks; high test--retest reliability ($>0.95$) coexists with severe position bias ($>0.10$) in two production-deployed judges; and verbosity bias is small ($<0.011$) across our cohort under a single pairwise rubric.

These findings translate into four practical recommendations. Judge validation should: (1) be chance-corrected by default, because raw exact match overstates discriminative ability by tens of percentage points, (2) span at least two benchmarks of contrasting label structure, since no single leaderboard predicts another's, (3) measure consistency and bias jointly, because high test--retest can mask a determinism that violates position invariance, and (4) no longer foreground verbosity bias under standard pairwise rubrics, subject to scope caveats. We introduce these as a Minimum Viable Validation Protocol (Section~) and will release the full dataset and the [anonymized] evaluation library upon publication so that future judges can be measured against the same baseline.

Several research directions remain open. Multilingual and multimodal judging are likely to surface failure modes that text-only English benchmarks cannot expose. Temporal stability across hosted-model endpoints, whose weights and serving stacks change without versioning, deserves dedicated longitudinal study. Judge-confidence calibration (Expected Calibration Error, Brier score) is a natural extension to this protocol once provider logprob coverage broadens. Finally, a formal variance-component decomposition that treats runs, items, and position orderings as random effects would convert the empirical patterns reported here into structured reliability coefficients, providing a principled basis for sample-size and replicate-count decisions in future judge-validation work.

All evaluation runs were executed

endpoints are known to drift across provider-side updates, sometimes
silently, and we have not yet re-evaluated these judges over time to
quantify within-judge stability over a longer time horizon. Consequently, the numbers we
report should be interpreted as a snapshot of provider behavior during this specific window.

All judges were evaluated under a

operationalization , should
not be interpreted as a universal claim that verbosity bias is solved.
Rubric design choices, including reference grounding and reasoning
instructions, are known to interact with bias profiles in ways our
single-template design cannot isolate.

output budget. Reasoning-enabled evaluations could change agreement,
consistency, and bias profiles, and we do not claim our results
characterize the thinking-on configuration.

[Section: Complete Results Tables]
This section reports per-judge values that the body figures and
tables summarize: full agreement statistics on all three benchmarks
(Table~), per-judge cross-benchmark ranks
with Cohen's $$ (Table~), and per-judge
consistency-protocol detail for the 17-judge consistency cohort
(Table~). Numerical values are extracted
from raw [anonymized]/results/*.json outputs and matched to the
display names used elsewhere in the paper.

[Section: C.1 Formulation context]
Seven hypotheses (H1--H7) were formulated on 2026-04-14, before Phase
6 (frontier-model) data collection began, based on patterns observed
in the earlier phases (Phases 1--5). The predictions were recorded
internally and were not deposited with an external registry; we do
not claim the methodological status of formal pre-registration. We
report the unmodified outcome of each hypothesis test below, including
the one we did not confirm. The intent of recording the predictions
in advance is to make the calibration of our expectations available
to readers, not to claim a formal confirmatory frame.

[Section: C.3 Calibration assessment]
Of the seven a priori predictions, three are fully confirmed (H1, H3,
H7), one is confirmed for the explicitly-stated subset (H6), two are
partially confirmed (H2, H4), and one is refuted (H5). The mixture
matters as a calibration signal: hypotheses formulated post hoc would
typically be confirmed at a higher rate. The presence of one
refutation (H5: RewardBench was predicted to be degenerate, but
position-randomized evaluation shows valid $ [0.616, 0.898]$)
and two partial outcomes (H2: thinking architecture does not reliably
reduce position bias; H4: ceiling holds for the top tier but not the
full cohort) indicates that the prediction set was non-trivially hard
rather than a curated yes-set. The body §3.4 disclosure reports this
in line with the user-facing methodological framing.

[Section: RewardBench Loader Configuration]
The RewardBench evaluation in this study uses per-item position
randomization with seed $42$, matching the contract of the official
run\_generative.py script that ships with the benchmark.
This configuration is necessary because the standard
generative-evaluation loader places every chosen response in
position A and every rejected response in position B; under that
fixed ordering the human label is identically ``A'' across all
items, $p_e$ collapses, and Cohen's $$ degenerates to $0.000$
for every judge. Per-item randomization with a fixed seed restores a
balanced ordering distribution and produces a valid agreement signal.

The validity of the corrected loader is confirmed by the resulting
$$ distribution: across the 21 judges evaluated on RewardBench,
$$ values fall in the range $[0.616, 0.898]$, well within the
substantial-to-near-perfect agreement bands. The full per-judge
$$ values appear in Table~ of this
appendix.

[Section: Evaluation Phase Details]
The evaluation campaign was conducted in seven phases over a
five-week window in March and April 2026. Phases 1--5 evaluated
Tier-1 production judges and Tier-2 cost-tier comparisons; Phase 6
added the Tier-3 frontier judges (April 2026 SoTA) on the agreement
and bias-audit protocols; Phase 7 added the Tier-3 consistency runs.
Total run count is 118, matching the production state ledger.
Approximately $541,000$ judgments were produced.

[Section: Use of AI Assistance]
The authors used AI assistance (large language model--based writing
assistants) for editing and manuscript-formatting support only:
specifically, copy-editing prose, normalizing table and reference
formatting, debugging LaTeX layout, and routine BibTeX hygiene. AI
assistance was not used for original writing of research claims, for
code generation in the evaluation experiments, or for any aspect of
research design, hypothesis formulation, data collection, or data
analysis. All experimental results, metric computations, and findings
reported in this paper were produced and verified by the authors
using the framework and methods described in Sections~
and~.

[Section: Potential Risks.]
The paper does not introduce a new judge model, training data, or
deployment-ready system, so direct deployment harms are minimal. The
principal indirect risks are: (i) selective adoption of the Minimum
Viable Validation Protocol (Section~) partial
adoption, e.g.\ reporting Cohen's $$ alone without the paired
position-swap and consistency checks, can produce a false sense of
having addressed judge reliability; (ii) interpreting the released
evaluation dataset as authoritative beyond its temporal scope
(March--April 2026) for judges whose hosted-model endpoints
subsequently drift; and (iii) over-correction: practitioners
discounting useful evaluation pipelines on the basis of the
kappa-deflation finding rather than supplementing them with
chance-corrected metrics. We discuss the temporal-scope risk
explicitly in the Limitations.

[Section: Documentation of Artifacts.]
The released artifact is an evaluation dataset of $118$ evaluation
runs spanning $21$ LLM judges, three benchmarks, and three protocols
(approximately $541,000$ individual judgments). Languages:
all three source benchmarks are English; multilingual coverage is out
of scope (Limitations). Modality: text only.
Domains: MT-Bench is general open-ended conversational
quality; JudgeBench spans mathematics, coding, creative writing, and
analysis; RewardBench is chosen/rejected preference pairs across
general instruction-following tasks. Demographic groups: the
human-label annotations are inherited from each source benchmark (we
do not collect new human annotations); please refer to the cited
benchmark papers for annotator demographic coverage.
License: the release will be distributed under a permissive
open license at publication time. Each released record includes the
per-item judge verdict, the judge's free-form reasoning trace, the
raw model response, per-call latency, and the metric values computed
for the run, keyed by (judge\_id, benchmark,
protocol, item\_id, run\_idx,
position\_order).

[Section: Descriptive Statistics.]
For each (judge, benchmark) cell in the agreement and bias-audit
tables we report a single value per metric rather than means with
confidence intervals: agreement-protocol values are population
statistics computed over the full benchmark (not sample estimates),
and bias-audit values are point estimates over paired AB+BA
evaluations. Consistency-protocol values (test--retest,
self-consistency, position flip rate) summarize $N [3, 5]$
replicate runs per item and are themselves point estimates of
within-judge stability: Phase~4 (Tier~1) uses 5 replicates per
item, Phase~5 (Tier~2) uses 5 replicates, and Phase~7 (Tier~3) uses 3
replicates. Cohort-level summary rows (e.g., the ``Cohort mean'' rows
in Table~ and Appendix
Tables~ and~)
are unweighted means across the judges in the relevant cohort. All
single-run reporting was conducted at temperature $0$ for
deterministic generation.

[Section: Parameters for Packages.]
All evaluation runs were executed using the [anonymized]
framework with the following per-protocol settings: temperature $0$
for all judges, no response caching for the consistency protocol
(caching enabled for agreement and bias-audit), and position-swap
(AB+BA) debiasing in the consistency and bias-audit protocols. Metric
implementations follow canonical formulations: Cohen's $$ uses
the standard two-rater nominal formula with no smoothing
; Krippendorff's $$ uses the
nominal-distance function ;
tie-excluded exact match follows the pairwise denominator restriction
of ; position bias is
$ P() - 0.5 $ over paired AB+BA evaluations
; verbosity bias is the Pearson correlation
between response-length differential and verdict
; test--retest is Krippendorff's $$
across replicate runs . Provider-specific
reasoning-suppression settings appear in
Table~ (Appendix~). No
external evaluation packages (NLTK, SpaCy, ROUGE, etc.) were used;
all metric computations are reproducible from the released
[anonymized] framework source.
